First Polish-Soviet conflicts

The first serious armed conflict of the war took place around <TIMEX2 val="1919-02-14">February 14</TIMEX2> - <TIMEX2 val="1919-02-16">February 16</TIMEX2>, near the towns of Maniewicze and Biaroza in Belarus. By <TIMEX2 val="1919-02" mod="END">late February</TIMEX2> the Soviet westward advance had come to a halt. Both Polish and Soviet forces had also been engaging the Ukrainian forces, and active fighting was going on in the territories of the Baltic countries (cf. Estonian War of Independence, Latvian War of Independence, Lithuanian Wars of Independence).
In <TIMEX2 val="1919-03" mod="START">early March 1919</TIMEX2>, Polish units started an offensive, crossing the Neman River, taking Pinsk, and reaching the outskirts of Lida. Both the Soviet and Polish advances began around <TIMEX2 val="1919-04-XX">the same time</TIMEX2> in <TIMEX2 val="1919-04">April</TIMEX2> (Polish forces started a major offensive on <TIMEX2 val="1919-04-16">April 16</TIMEX2>), resulting in increasing numbers of troops arriving in the area. <TIMEX2 val="1919-04">That month</TIMEX2> the Red Army had captured Grodno, but was soon pushed out by a Polish counter-offensive. Unable to accomplish its objectives and facing strengthening offensives from the White forces, the Red Army withdrew from its positions and reorganized. Soon the Polish-Soviet War would begin in earnest. Polish forces continued a steady eastern advance. They took Lida on <TIMEX2 val="1919-04-17">April 17</TIMEX2> and Nowogródek on <TIMEX2 val="1919-04-18">April 18</TIMEX2>, and recaptured Vilnius on <TIMEX2 val="1919-04-19">April 19</TIMEX2>, driving the Litbel government from their proclaimed capital. On <TIMEX2 val="1919-08-08">August 8</TIMEX2>, Polish forces took Minsk and on <TIMEX2 val="1919-08-28">the 28th of that month</TIMEX2> they deployed tanks for the first time. After heavy fighting, the town of Babruysk near the Berezina River was captured. By <TIMEX2 val="1919-10-02">October 2</TIMEX2>, Polish forces reached the Daugava river and secured the region from Desna to Daugavpils (Dyneburg).
Polish success continued until <TIMEX2 val="1920" mod="START">early 1920</TIMEX2>. Sporadic battles erupted between Polish forces and the Red Army, but the latter was preoccupied with the White counter-revolutionary forces and was steadily retreating on the entire western frontline, from Latvia in the north to Ukraine in the south. In <TIMEX2 val="1919-SU" mod="START">early summer 1919</TIMEX2>, the White movement had gained the initiative, and its forces under the command of Anton Denikin were marching on Moscow. Piłsudski was aware that the Soviets were not friends of independent Poland, and considered war with Soviet Russia inevitable. He viewed their westward advance as a major issue, but also thought that he could get a better deal for Poland from the Bolsheviks than their Russian civil war contenders, as the White Russians - representatives of the old Russian Empire, partitioner of Poland - were willing to accept only limited independence of Poland, likely in the borders similar to that of Congress Poland, and clearly objected to Ukrainian independence, crucial for Piłsudski's Międzymorze, while the Bolsheviks did proclaim the partitions null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with the restored Russian Empire. By his refusal to join the attack on Lenin's struggling government, ignoring the strong pressure from the Entente, Piłsudski had likely saved the Bolshevik government in <TIMEX2 val="1919-SU">summer</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1919-FA">fall 1919</TIMEX2>. He later wrote that in case of a White victory, in the east Poland could only gain the "ethnic border" at best (the Curzon line). At <TIMEX2 val="1919">the same time</TIMEX2>, Lenin offered Poles the territories of Minsk, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, in what was described as mini "Brest"; Polish military leader Kazimierz Sosnkowski wrote that the territorial proposals of the Bolsheviks were much better than what the Poles had wanted to achieve.

Diplomatic front, part 1: the alliances

In <TIMEX2 val="1919">1919</TIMEX2>, several unsuccessful attempts at peace negotiations were made by various Polish and Russian factions. In the meantime, Polish-Lithuanian relations worsened as Polish politicians found it hard to accept the Lithuanians' demands for independence and territories, especially on ceding the city of Vilnius, Lithuania's historical capital which had a Polish ethnic majority. Polish negotiators made better progress with the Latvian Provisional Government, and in <TIMEX2 val="1919" mod="END">late 1919</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1920" mod="START">early 1920</TIMEX2> Polish and Latvian forces were conducting joint operations including the Battle of Daugavpils, against Soviet Russia.
The Warsaw Treaty, an agreement with the exiled Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlura signed on <TIMEX2 val="1920-04-21">April 21, 1920</TIMEX2>, was the main Polish diplomatic success. Petlura, who formally represented the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic (by then de facto defeated by Bolsheviks), along with some Ukrainian forces, fled to Poland, where he found asylum. His control extended only to a sliver of land near the Polish border. In such conditions, there was little difficulty convincing Petlura to join an alliance with Poland, despite <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1920-04-21" anchor_dir="BEFORE">recent</TIMEX2> conflict between the two nations that had been settled in favour of Poland. By concluding an agreement with Piłsudski, Petlura accepted the Polish territorial gains in Western Ukraine and the <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" anchor_val="1920-04-21" anchor_dir="AFTER">future</TIMEX2> Polish-Ukrainian border along the Zbruch River. In exchange, he was promised independence for Ukraine and Polish military assistance in reinstalling his government in Kiev.
For Piłsudski, this alliance gave his campaign for the Międzymorze federation the legitimacy of joint international effort, secured part of the Polish eastward border, and laid a foundation for a Polish-dominated Ukrainian state between Russia and Poland. For Petlura, this was the final chance to preserve the statehood and, at least, the theoretical independence of the Ukrainian heartlands, even while accepting the loss of western Ukrainian lands to Poland.
Yet both of them were opposed at home. Piłsudski faced stiff opposition from Dmowski's National Democrats who opposed Ukrainian independence. Petlura, in turn, was criticized by many Ukrainian politicians for entering a pact with the Poles and giving up on Western Ukraine.
The alliance with Petliura did result in 15,000 pro-Polish allied Ukrainian troops at the beginning of the campaign, increasing to 35,000 through recruitment and desertion from the Soviet side during the war. But in the end, this would prove too few to support Petlura's hopes for independent Ukraine, or Piłsudski's dreams of a Ukrainian ally in the Międzymorze federation.

<TIMEX2 val="1920">1920</TIMEX2>

The tide turns: Operation Kiev

Until <TIMEX2 val="1920-04">April</TIMEX2>, the Polish forces had been slowly but steadily advancing eastward. The new Latvian government requested and obtained Polish help in capturing Daugavpils. The city fell after heavy fighting at the Battle of Daugavpils in <TIMEX2 val="1920-01">January</TIMEX2> and was handed over to the Latvians. By <TIMEX2 val="1920-03">March</TIMEX2>, Polish forces had driven a wedge between Soviet forces to the north (Belorussia) and south (Ukraine).
On <TIMEX2 val="1920-04-24">April 24</TIMEX2>, Poland began its main offensive, Operation Kiev. Its stated goal was the creation of an independent Ukraine that would become part of Piłsudski's project of a "Międzymorze" Federation. Poland's forces were assisted by 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers under Symon Petlura, representing the Ukrainian People's Republic.
On <TIMEX2 val="1920-04-26">April 26</TIMEX2>, in his "Call to the People of Ukraine", Piłsudski told his audience that "the Polish army would only stay as long as necessary until a legal Ukrainian government took control over its own territory". Despite this, many Ukrainians were just as anti-Polish as anti-Bolshevik, and resented the Polish advance.
The Polish 3rd Army easily won border clashes with the Red Army in Ukraine but the Reds withdrew with minimal losses. The combined Polish-Ukrainian forces entered an abandoned Kiev on <TIMEX2 val="1920-05-07">May 7</TIMEX2>, encountering only token resistance.
The Polish military thrust was met with Red Army counterattacks on <TIMEX2 val="1920-05-29">29 May</TIMEX2>. Polish forces in the area, preparing for an offensive towards Zhlobin, managed to hold their ground, but were unable to start their own planned offensive. In the north, Polish forces had fared much worse. The Polish 1st Army was defeated and forced to retreat, pursued by the Russian 15th Army which recaptured territories between the Western Dvina and Berezina rivers. Polish forces attempted to take advantage of the exposed flanks of the attackers but the enveloping forces failed to stop the Soviet advance. At <TIMEX2 val="1920-05" mod="END">the end of May</TIMEX2>, the front had stabilised near the small river Auta, and Soviet forces began preparing for the next push.
On <TIMEX2 val="1920-05-24">May 24 1920</TIMEX2>, the Polish forces in the south were engaged for the first time by Semyon Budyonny's famous 1st Cavalry Army (Konarmia). Repeated attacks by Budyonny's Cossack cavalry broke the Polish-Ukrainian front on <TIMEX2 val="1920-06-05">June 5</TIMEX2>. The Soviets then deployed mobile cavalry units to disrupt the Polish rearguard, targeting communications and logistics. By <TIMEX2 val="1920-06-10">June 10</TIMEX2>, Polish armies were in retreat along the entire front. On <TIMEX2 val="1920-06-13">June 13</TIMEX2>, the Polish army, along with the Petlura's Ukrainian troops, abandoned Kiev to the Red Army.

String of Soviet victories

The Russian counter-offensive was boosted by Aleksei Brusilov's engagement; 14,000 officers and over 100,000 deserters enlisted in or returned to the Red Army, and thousands of civilian volunteers contributed to the effort.
The commander of the Polish 3rd Army in Ukraine, General Edward Rydz-Śmigły, decided to break through the Soviet line toward the northwest. Polish forces in Ukraine managed to withdraw relatively unscathed, but were unable to support the northern front and reinforce the defenses at the Auta River for the decisive battle that was soon to take place there.
Due to insufficient forces, Poland's 200-mile-long front was manned by a thin line of 120,000 troops backed by some 460 artillery pieces with no strategic reserves. This approach to holding ground harked back to the World War I practice of "establishing a fortified line of defense". It had shown some merit on the Western Front saturated with troops, machine guns, and artillery. Poland's eastern front, however, was weakly manned, supported with inadequate artillery, and had almost no fortifications.
Against the Polish line the Red Army gathered its Northwest Front led by the young General Mikhail Tukhachevsky. Their numbers exceeded 108,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry, supported by 722 artillery pieces and 2,913 machine guns. The Soviets at some crucial places outnumbered the Poles four-to-one.
Tukhachevsky launched his offensive on <TIMEX2 val="1920-07-04">July 4</TIMEX2>, along the Smolensk-Brest-Litovsk axis, crossing the Auta and Berezina rivers. The northern 3rd Cavalry Corps, led by Gayk Bzhishkyan (Gay Dmitrievich Gay, Gaj-Chan), were to envelop Polish forces from the north, moving near the Lithuanian and Prussian border (both of these belonging to nations hostile to Poland). The 4th, 15th, and 3rd Armies were to push west, supported from the south by the 16th Army and Grupa Mozyrska. For <TIMEX2 val="P3D" anchor_val="1920-07-04" anchor_dir="STARTING">three days</TIMEX2> the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but the Soviet' numerical superiority proved decisive and by <TIMEX2 val="1920-07-07">July 7</TIMEX2> Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front. However, due to the stubborn defense by Polish units, Tukhachevsky's plan to break through the front and push the defenders southwest into the Pinsk Marshes failed.
Polish resistance was offered again on a line of "German trenches", a heavily fortified line of World War I field fortifications that presented an opportunity to stem the Red Army offensive. However, the Polish troops were insufficient in number. Soviet forces found a weakly defended part of the front and broke through. Gej-Chan and Lithuanian forces captured Vilnius on <TIMEX2 val="1920-07-14">14 July</TIMEX2>, forcing the Poles into retreat again. In Galicia to the south, General Semyon Budyonny's cavalry advanced far into the Polish rear, capturing Brodno and approaching Lwów and Zamość. In <TIMEX2 val="1920-07" mod="START">early July</TIMEX2>, it became clear to the Poles that the Soviets' objectives were not limited to pushing their borders westwards. Poland's very independence was at stake.
Soviet forces moved forward at the remarkable rate of 20 miles (32 km) <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" set="YES">a day</TIMEX2>. Grodno in Belarus fell on <TIMEX2 val="1920-07-19">19 July</TIMEX2>; Brest-Litovsk fell on <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-01">1 August</TIMEX2>. The Polish attempted to defend the Bug River line with 4th Army and Grupa Poleska units, but were able to delay the Red Army advance for <TIMEX2 val="P1W" anchor_val="1920-08-01" anchor_dir="AFTER">only one week</TIMEX2>. After crossing the Narew River on <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-02">2 August</TIMEX2>, the Soviet Northwest Front was only 60 miles (97 km) from Warsaw. The Brest-Litovsk fortress which was to be the headquarters of the planned Polish counteroffensive fell to the 16th Army in the first attack. The Soviet Southwest Front pushed the Polish forces out of Ukraine. Stalin had then disobeyed his orders and ordered his forces to close on Zamość, as well as Lwów - the largest city in southeastern Poland and an important industrial center, garrisoned by the Polish 6th Army. The city was soon besieged. This created a hole in the lines of the Red Army, but at <TIMEX2>the same time</TIMEX2> opened the way to the Polish capital. Five Soviet armies approached Warsaw. Polish politicians tried to secure peace with Moscow on any conditions but the Bolsheviks refused.
Polish forces in Galicia near Lwów launched a successful counteroffensive to slow down the Red Army advance. This stopped the retreat of Polish forces on the southern front. However, the worsening situation near the Polish capital of Warsaw prevented the Poles from continuing that southern counteroffensive and pushing east. Forces were mustered to take part in the coming battle for Warsaw.

Diplomatic Front, Part 2

With the tide turning against Poland, Piłsudski's political power weakened, while his opponents', including Roman Dmowski's, rose. Piłsudski did manage to regain his influence, especially over the military, almost at the last moment-as the Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw. The Polish political scene had begun to unravel in panic, with the government of Leopold Skulski resigning in <TIMEX2 val="1920-06">early June</TIMEX2>.
Meanwhile, the Soviet leadership's confidence soared. In a telegram, Lenin exclaimed: "We must direct all our attention to preparing and strengthening the Western Front. A new slogan must be announced: 'Prepare for war against Poland'." Soviet communist theorist Nikolay Bukharin, writer for the newspaper Pravda, wished for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw "right up to London and Paris". General Tukhachevsky's order of <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX">the day</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="1920-07-02">2 July, 1920</TIMEX2> read: "To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to worldwide conflagration. March on Vilno, Minsk, Warsaw!" and "onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland!" The increasing hope of certain victory, however, gave rise to political intrigues between Soviet commanders.
By order of the Soviet Communist Party, a Polish puppet government, the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee (Polish: Tymczasowy Komitet Rewolucyjny Polski, TKRP), had been formed on <TIMEX2 val="1920-07-28">28 July</TIMEX2> in Białystok to organise administration of the Polish territories captured by the Red Army. The TKRP had very little support from the ethnic Polish population and recruited its supporters mostly from the ranks of minorities, primarily Jews. At the height of the Polish-Soviet conflict, Jews had been subject to anti-semitic violence by Polish forces, who considered Jews to be a potential threat, and who often accused Jews as being the masterminds of Russian Bolshevism; during the Battle of Warsaw, the Polish government interned all Jewish volunteers and sent Jewish volunteer officers to an internment camp.
Britain's Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, who wanted to negotiate a favourable trade agreement with the Bolsheviks pressed Poland to make peace on Soviet terms and refused any assistance to Poland which would alienate the Whites in the Russian Civil War. In <TIMEX2 val="1920-07">July 1920</TIMEX2>, Britain announced it would send huge quantities of World War I surplus military supplies to Poland, but a threatened general strike by the Trades Union Congress, who objected to British support of "White Poland", ensured that none of the weapons destined for Poland left British ports. David Lloyd George had never been enthusiastic about supporting the Poles, and had been pressured by his more right-wing Cabinet members such as Lord Curzon and Winston Churchill into offering the supplies. On <TIMEX2 val="1920-07-11">the 11 July, 1920</TIMEX2>, the government of Great Britain issued a de facto ultimatum to the Soviets. It demanded the Soviets to stop hostilities against Poland and the Russian Army (the White Army in Southern Russia lead by Baron Wrangel), and to accept what later was called the "Curzon line" as a temporary border with Poland, until a permanent border could be established in negotiations. In case of Soviet refusal, the British threatened to assist Poland with all the means available, which, in reality, were limited by the internal political situation in the United Kingdom. On <TIMEX2 val="1920-07-17">the 17 July</TIMEX2>, the Bolsheviks refused and made a counter-offer to negotiate a peace treaty directly with Poland. The British responded by threatening to cut off the on-going trade negotiations if the Soviets conducted further offensives against Poland. These threats were ignored.
The threatened general strike was a convenient excuse for Lloyd George to back out of his commitments. On <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-06">August 6, 1920</TIMEX2>, the British Labour Party published a pamphlet stating that British workers would never take part in the war as Poland's allies, and labour unions blocked supplies to the British expeditionary force assisting Russian Whites in Arkhangelsk. French Socialists, in their newspaper L'Humanité, declared: "Not a man, not a sou, not a shell for reactionary and capitalist Poland. Long live the Russian Revolution! Long live the Workmen's International!" Poland also suffered setbacks due to sabotage and delays in deliveries of war supplies, when workers in Czechoslovakia and Germany refused to transit such materials to Poland. On <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-06">August 6</TIMEX2> the Polish government issued an "Appeal to the World", disputing charges of imperialism, stressing Poland's determination for self-determination and the dangers of Bolshevik "invasion of Europe".
Poland's neighbor Lithuania had been engaged in serious disputes with Poland over the city of Vilnius and the borderlands surrounding Sejny and Suwalki. A <TIMEX2 val="1919">1919</TIMEX2> Polish attempt to take control over the entire nation by a coup had additionally disrupted their relationship. The Soviet and Lithuanian governments signed the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of <TIMEX2 val="1920">1920</TIMEX2> on <TIMEX2 val="1920-07-12">July 12</TIMEX2>; this treaty recognized Vilnius as part of Lithuania. The treaty contained a secret clause allowing Soviet forces unrestricted movement within Soviet-recognized Lithuanian territory during any Soviet war with Poland; this clause would lead to questions regarding the issue of Lithuanian neutrality in the ongoing Polish-Soviet War. The Lithuanians also provided the Soviets with logistical support. Despite Lithuanian support, the Soviets did not transfer Vilnius to the Lithuanians till just before the city was to be recaptured by the Polish forces (in <TIMEX2 val="1920-08" mod="END">late August</TIMEX2>), instead up till <TIMEX2 val="1920-08" mod="END">that time</TIMEX2> the Soviets encouraged their own, pro-communist Lithuanian government, Litbel, and were planning a pro-communist coup in Lithuania. The simmering conflict between Poland and Lithuania culminated in the Polish-Lithuanian War in <TIMEX2 val="1920-08">August 1920</TIMEX2>.
Polish allies were few. France, continuing its policy of countering Bolshevism <TIMEX2>now</TIMEX2> that the Whites in Russia proper had been almost completely defeated, sent a 400-strong advisory group to Poland's aid in <TIMEX2 val="1919">1919</TIMEX2>. It consisted mostly of French officers, although it also included a few British advisers led by Lieutenant General Sir Adrian Carton De Wiart. The French officers included a <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" anchor_val="1919" anchor_dir="AFTER">future</TIMEX2> President of France, Charles de Gaulle; during the war he won Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari. In addition to the Allied advisors, France also facilitated the transit to Poland from France of the "Blue Army" in <TIMEX2 val="1919">1919</TIMEX2>: troops mostly of Polish origin, plus some international volunteers, <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1919" anchor_dir="BEFORE">formerly</TIMEX2> under French command in World War I. The army was commanded by the Polish general, Józef Haller. Hungary offered to send a 30,000 cavalry corps to Poland's aid, but the Czechoslovakian government refused to allow them through as there was a demilitarized zone on the borders after the Czech-Hungarian war which ended only <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1919-XX" anchor_dir="BEFORE">a few months before</TIMEX2>; some trains with weapon supplies from Hungary did, however, arrive in Poland.
In <TIMEX2 val="1920" mod="MID">mid-1920</TIMEX2>, the Allied Mission was expanded by some advisers (becoming the Interallied Mission to Poland). They included: French diplomat, Jean Jules Jusserand; Maxime Weygand, chief of staff to Marshal Ferdinand Foch, Supreme Commander of the victorious Entente; and British diplomat, Lord Edgar Vincent D'Abernon. The newest members of the mission achieved little; indeed, the crucial Battle of Warsaw was fought and won by the Poles before the mission could return and make its report. Nonetheless for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" anchor_val="1920" anchor_dir="STARTING">many years</TIMEX2>, a myth persisted that it was the timely arrival of Allied forces that had saved Poland, a myth in which Weygand occupied the central role. Nonetheless Polish-French cooperation would continue. Eventually, on <TIMEX2 val="1921-02-21">the 21 February, 1921</TIMEX2>, France and Poland entered into a formal military alliance, which became an important factor during the subsequent Soviet-Polish negotiations.

The tide turns again: The "Miracle at the Vistula"

On <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-10">August 10, 1920</TIMEX2>, Soviet Cossack units under the command of Gayk Bzhishkyan crossed the Vistula river, planning to take Warsaw from the west while the main attack came from the east. On <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-13">August 13</TIMEX2>, an initial Soviet attack was repulsed. The Polish 1st Army resisted a direct assault on Warsaw as well as stopping the assault at Radzymin.
The Soviet commander-in-chief, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, felt certain that all was going according to his plan. However, Polish military intelligence had decrypted the Red Army's radio messages, and Tukhachevsky was actually falling into a trap set by Piłsudski and his Chief of Staff, Tadeusz Rozwadowski. The Soviet advance across the Vistula River in the north was moving into an operational vacuum, as there were no sizable Polish forces in the area. On the other hand, south of Warsaw, where the fate of the war was about to be decided, Tukhachevsky had left only token forces to guard the vital link between the Soviet northwest and southwest fronts. Another factor that influenced the outcome of the war was the effective neutralization of Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army, much feared by Piłsudski and other Polish commanders, in the battles around Lwów. The Soviet High Command, at Tukhachevsky's insistence, had ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march north toward Warsaw and Lublin, but Budyonny disobeyed the order due to a grudge between Tukhachevsky and Yegorov, commander of the southwest front. Additionally, the political games of Joseph Stalin, chief political commissar of the Southwest Front, decisively influenced the disobedience of Yegorov and Budyonny. Stalin, seeking a personal triumph, was focused on capturing Lwów-far to the southeast of Warsaw-which was besieged by Bolshevik forces but still resisted their assaults.
The Polish 5th Army under General Władysław Sikorski counterattacked on <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-14">August 14</TIMEX2> from the area of the Modlin fortress, crossing the Wkra River. It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In <TIMEX2 val="P1D" anchor_val="1920-08-14" anchor_dir="STARTING">one day</TIMEX2> the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and Modlin had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" set="YES">a day</TIMEX2>, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-16">August 16</TIMEX2>, the Polish counteroffensive had been fully joined by Marshal Piłsudski's "Reserve Army." Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, advancing from the south, found a huge gap between the Soviet fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet "Mozyr Group" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevsky's forces, the majority of which were encircled by <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-18">August 18</TIMEX2>. Only <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-18">that same day</TIMEX2> did Tukhachevsky, at his Minsk headquarters 300 miles (480 km) east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all.
The Soviet armies in the center of the front fell into chaos. Tukhachevsky ordered a general retreat toward the Bug River, but by then he had lost contact with most of his forces near Warsaw, and all the Bolshevik plans had been thrown into disarray by communication failures.
The Bolshevik armies retreated in a disorganised fashion; entire divisions panicking and disintegrating. The Red Army's defeat was so great and unexpected that, at the instigation of Piłsudski's detractors, the Battle of Warsaw is often referred to in Poland as the "Miracle at the Vistula". Previously unknown documents from Polish Central Military Archive found in <TIMEX2 val="2004">2004</TIMEX2> proved that the successful breaking of Red Army radio communications ciphers by Polish cryptographers played a great role in the victory.
The advance of Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army toward Lwów was halted, first at the battle of Brody (<TIMEX2 val="1920-07-29">July 29</TIMEX2> - <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-02">August 2</TIMEX2>), and then on <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-17">August 17</TIMEX2> at the Battle of Zadwórze, where a small Polish force sacrificed itself to prevent Soviet cavalry from seizing Lwów and stopping vital Polish reinforcements from moving toward Warsaw. Moving through weakly defended areas, Budyonny's cavalry reached the city of Zamość on <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-29">29 August</TIMEX2> and attempted to take it in the battle of Zamość; however, he soon faced an increasing number of Polish units diverted from the successful Warsaw counteroffensive. On <TIMEX2 val="1920-08-31">August 31</TIMEX2>, Budyonny's cavalry finally broke off its siege of Lwów and attempted to come to the aid of Soviet forces retreating from Warsaw. The Soviet forces were intercepted and defeated by Polish cavalry at the Battle of Komarów near Zamość, the largest cavalry battle since <TIMEX2 val="1813">1813</TIMEX2> and one of the last cavalry battles in history. Although Budyonny's army managed to avoid encirclement, it suffered heavy losses and its morale plummeted. The remains of Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army retreated towards Volodymyr-Volynskyi on <TIMEX2 val="1920-09-06">6 September</TIMEX2> and was defeated shortly thereafter at the Battle of Hrubieszów.
Tukhachevsky managed to reorganize the eastward-retreating forces and in <TIMEX2 val="1920-09">September</TIMEX2> established a new defensive line running from the Polish-Lithuanian border to the north to the area of Polesie, with the central point in the city of Grodno in Belarus. The Polish Army broke this line in the Battle of the Niemen River. Polish forces crossed the Niemen River and outflanked the Bolshevik forces, which were forced to retreat again. Polish forces continued to advance east on all fronts, repeating their successes from <TIMEX2 val="1919">the previous year</TIMEX2>. After the <TIMEX2 val="1920-10" mod="START">early October</TIMEX2> Battle of the Szczara River, the Polish Army had reached the Ternopil-Dubno-Minsk-Drisa line.
In the south, Petliura's Ukrainian forces defeated the Bolshevik 14th Army and on <TIMEX2 val="1920-09-18">September 18</TIMEX2> took control of the left bank of the Zbruch river.

Conclusion

Soon after the Battle of Warsaw the Bolsheviks sued for peace. The Poles, exhausted, constantly pressured by the Western governments and the League of Nations, and with its army controlling the majority of the disputed territories, were willing to negotiate. The Soviets made two offers: one on <TIMEX2 val="1920-09-21">21 September</TIMEX2> and the other on <TIMEX2 val="1920-09-28">28 September</TIMEX2>. The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on <TIMEX2 val="1920-10-02">2 October</TIMEX2>. On <TIMEX2 val="1920-10-05">the 5th</TIMEX2>, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer which Poland accepted. The armistice between Poland on one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on <TIMEX2 val="1920-10-12">12 October</TIMEX2> and went into effect on <TIMEX2 val="1920-10-18">18 October</TIMEX2>. Long negotiations of the peace treaty ensued.
